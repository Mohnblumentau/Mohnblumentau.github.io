Hi, my name is Nadine. As a dedicated game developer, I strive to be a reliable and flexible team member, supporting my colleagues in creating innovative and captivating games that engage and inspire players. 

During my bachelor's degree program, I gained a solid understanding of both frontend and backend software development, successfully bridging the two in various projects. Ultimately, I chose to pursue my passion for the gaming industry by seeking out new experiences and challenges.

I am curious and eager to learn new technologies, and I enjoy expressing my creativity by finding solutions to programming problems. Therefore, I am seeking an exciting and meaningful role that offers professional development opportunities.
