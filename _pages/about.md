Hi, my name is Nadine. As a dedicated software developer, I strive to be the reliable and flexible colleague who supports my team in developing an innovative software solution.
During my application oriented bachelor's degree program I acquired a firm understanding of both frontend and backend software development, as well as connecting both areas in a multitude of different projects.

I am very curious and eager to learn new technologies and I love expressing my creativity by finding solutions and strategies to complex programming problems. 
Therefore, I am looking for an exciting and meaningful new role with professional development opportunities.
