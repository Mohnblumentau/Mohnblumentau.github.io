Hi, my name is Nadine. As a dedicated software and game developer, I strive to be the reliable and flexible colleague who supports my team in developing innovative solutions. During my practice-oriented bachelor's degree program, I gained a solid understanding of both frontend and backend software development, successfully bridging the two in various projects. I am very curious and eager to learn new technologies and I love expressing my creativity by finding solutions and strategies to complex programming problems. My favorite programming languages to date are Java, C/C++ and C#. Additionally, I enjoy working with SQL and NoSQL databases.

I have a great passion for game development, where I love crafting gameplay mechanics and working on the 3Cs (Character, Controls and Camera) in Unity and Unreal Engine to create immersive experiences that captivate players.

Therefore, I am seeking an exciting and meaningful role as a developer in the software or gaming industry that offers professional growth opportunities.
