Hi, my name is Nadine. I strive to be the reliable and adaptable developer my team needs to create innovative
and exciting games that fascinate and capture players. I'm very curious and eager to learn about new technologies and tools and I love to express my creativity by finding solutions to coding challenges. During my bachelor's degree I acquired a firm understanding of both frontend and backend software development, as well as connecting these areas. But ultimately, I decided for my master's degree to follow my passion and applied for a game developer-specific program.
