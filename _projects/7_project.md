For this project the prototype called "TravelMate" was designed and realized, including Usibility/UX Tests. 
TravelMate is an App that connects traveling individuals with each other, but also people who are planing to travel and search for a travel companion. It allows to exchange information like interests and what one is looking for to help find the ideal match.

The first Mock-ups were created with Balsamiq to get a rough layout of the application that can be easily adjusted.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="/assets/img/TravelMate/BalsamiqMockUp1.png" title="TravelMate" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="/assets/img/TravelMate/BalsamiqMockUp2.png" title="TravelMate" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="/assets/img/TravelMate/BalsamiqMockUp3.png" title="TravelMate" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

The final prototype is done with JustinMind. This allowed for detailed user tests to review Usability and UX, because JustinMind offers many additional functionality as well as a more realistic visualisation.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="/assets/img/TravelMate/RegisterScreen.jpg" title="TravelMate" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="/assets/img/TravelMate/Blackboard.jpg" title="TravelMate" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="/assets/img/TravelMate/SearchResults.jpg" title="TravelMate" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
