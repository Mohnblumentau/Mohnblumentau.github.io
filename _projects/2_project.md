In order to gain points the other players must be destroyed by dashing into them. The game has different play modes like Hide and Seek, Reach the Goals, Free for all Race, Destroy the Town and Krakattack.
The Game was developed in a team of two in Unity with C# during my master's degree, I was deeply involved in the implementation and finding of the vision in the first year of the development. My responsibilities were the Game Design and during the many iterations of the developing of the game I was also involved in implementing Gameplay Mechanics in C#.

Additional information about the game can be found on the <a href="https://portfolio.fh-salzburg.ac.at/projects/2020-carotic">Carotic Portfolio Page</a> of FH Salzburg. It has also been released on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1524810/Carotic__Academic_Version/">Steam</a>.
